    "question": "What is a hackathon?",
    "answer": "A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who can attend?",
    "answer": "DVCHacks is open to all majors! As long as you're prepared to learn, brainstorm, and build cool things, we welcome you to join. We encourage participants to form teams of up to 4 people."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if I don’t have a team or idea?",
    "answer": "Don't worry! We’ll have team-forming activity to help you find teammates. Some of the best hacks usually come from teams that met and formed an idea on the spot!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What if I don’t know how to code?",
    "answer": "Not a problem! The entire organizing team knew very little when they each attended their very first hackathon. It’s entirely irrelevant what your experience is going into a hackathon, it’s more about your interest in technology. DVCHacks is made to be very welcoming and beginner-friendly. We will provide workshops and mentors to help you build something you will be proud of"
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I build?",
    "answer": "You can build whatever your heart desires, whether it's a web app, mobile app, hardware hack, or an open source tool. It is recommended to focus on a specific theme such as health/wellness, education, environment or entertainment, your choice! Our main focus is to bring you a learning experience where you can have fun, ask questions, and experiment with technology."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much does it cost?",
    "answer": "DVCHacks is free for all admitted participants. Don’t sweat it! We will provide you WiFi, meals, caffeine, swag, and workspace for the entire weekend."
