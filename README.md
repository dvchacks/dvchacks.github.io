## Tech Stack

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/)<br>
  Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.<br>
  We use it so we can work with Gulp, Webpack, and Panini in our project.
* [**Gulp**](https://gulpjs.com/)<br>
  Gulp is a toolkit for automating development workflow.<br>
  When any of the files changed, it calls other packages to process those files.
* [**Webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/)<br>
  Webpack bundles any Javascript dependencies we have into a single `bundle.js`.
* [**Panini**](https://github.com/zurb/panini)<br>
  Panini is a simple HTML files generator.<br>
  It will convert the templates in the `src` folder into HTML pages in the root folder.
* [**Foundation**](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)<br>
  Foundation is a responsive mobile-friendly front-end framework for designing websites.<br>
  It makes our website looks pretty!
